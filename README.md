# PENETRATION-TESTING-PRACTICE-LAB: VULNERABLE APPS SYSTEMS
Penetration Testing Practice Labs are controlled environments designed to simulate real-world security vulnerabilities across a variety of applications and systems. These labs are divided into specific categories to help cybersecurity professionals and enthusiasts focus on different aspects of vulnerability testing. Each category offers intentionally vulnerable apps and systems, allowing users to safely experiment with hacking techniques, understand system weaknesses, and develop strategies to fortify defenses against cyberattacks.

By practising in these labs, individuals can sharpen their skills in identifying, exploiting, and mitigating vulnerabilities, making them better prepared to address security threats in real-world scenarios. Whether you are a beginner or an advanced practitioner, these labs provide an essential, hands-on learning experience.

## ðŸ”´ WARNING ðŸ”´

- Only conduct your tests in environments explicitly created for learning purpose. 
- Never target live systems or networks without permission. Unauthorized testing is illegal and unethical.
- Ensure that any activity you perform aligns with ethical hacking standards and adheres to the law.
- After practising on vulnerable applications or downloading files, always scan your system for malware.
- Vulnerable systems can sometimes introduce unwanted malware if not handled carefully. Running antivirus and malware scans can help keep your machine clean.
- Pentesting skills improve with regular, responsible practice. Keep experimenting, but always with proper ethics and care.
