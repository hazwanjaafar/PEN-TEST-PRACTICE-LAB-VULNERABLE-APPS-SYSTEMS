# PENETRATION-TESTING-PRACTICE-LAB: VULNERABLE APPS SYSTEMS
Penetration Testing Practice Labs are controlled environments designed to simulate real-world security vulnerabilities across a variety of applications and systems. These labs are divided into specific categories to help cybersecurity professionals and enthusiasts focus on different aspects of vulnerability testing. Each category offers intentionally vulnerable apps and systems, allowing users to safely experiment with hacking techniques, understand system weaknesses, and develop strategies to fortify defenses against cyberattacks.

By practising in these labs, individuals can sharpen their skills in identifying, exploiting, and mitigating vulnerabilities, making them better prepared to address security threats in real-world scenarios. Whether you are a beginner or an advanced practitioner, these labs provide an essential, hands-on learning experience.
